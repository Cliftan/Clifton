# Repository for my Personal Website

This website uses a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I chose the Creative Commons (CC BY-NC 4.0) license because my personal website contains creative content, such as blog posts, portfolio pieces, and images, that I want to share while maintaining control over its commercial use. This license allows others to use and share my content with proper attribution but prevents them from profiting from it without permission.
